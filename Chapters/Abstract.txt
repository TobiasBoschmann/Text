The refining of quartz requires fluctuating amounts of hydrogen and oxygen. These are generated internally by the customer using an electrolyzer. Electrolysers produce hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed molar ratio, but a different molar ratio is required in some of the customer's process steps. For this reason, quantities of hydrogen that are not required for operation are generated, which in the current system escape unused into the atmosphere. In this thesis, a simulation study is used to examine whether the use of the excess gases can be meaningfully integrated into the manufacturer's energy system. As an extension of the current hydrogen energy system, a fuel cell, a photovoltaic system and an intermediate storage for the process gas are being considered. \\

In previous work, the Modelica library AixLib was developed at the institute, which among other things contains models of the relevant electronic components, such as the PV system. In the first step, models are created in Modelica for the required hydrogen components - in particular the electrolyser and fuel cell. A structure is selected that enables various systems to be modeled on the basis of characteristic values ​​from data sheets. \\
A validation of the component models shows that they are suitable for the investigations aimed at in this work: In the selected operating points, there are deviations of an average of less than $ \ SI {5,3} {\%} $ of the relevant output variables to measured values ​​from the Literature.\\

In the second step, possible concepts of the energy system are worked out. In particular, the use of a fuel cell for combined heat and power is considered. In addition, the integration of a photovoltaic system to cover the energy requirement and its addition to a gas storage facility is being investigated. \\
The concepts are then simulated in Modelica and finally an interpretation of the simulation results is carried out.
For the evaluation, the net present values ​​and the $ \ ce {CO2} $ savings of the system concepts are compared. \\

Investing in a fuel cell tends to turn out to be uneconomical, with the ecological assessment being positive. Optimizing the fuel cell concept promises significant improvements in net present value without significantly reducing the $ \ ce {CO2} $ savings. The PV system represents the most sensible extension of the current system according to the economic as well as the ecological assessment. The addition of a gas storage system to the PV system has no influence on the output parameters of the simulation and is therefore not assessed as sensible.
